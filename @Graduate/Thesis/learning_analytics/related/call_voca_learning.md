# Strategy Use in CALL-Based Self-Directed Foreign Language Vocabulary Learning

Jing Wu, Fudan University, Shanghai, China

## Abstract

- CALL-based self-directed vocabulary learning could significantly improve students' strategy use and thereby enhance their self-directed vocabulary learning **in comparison with the paper-based version**
- CALL system vs printed materials

## Keywords

CALL, vocabulary learning strategies, self-directed vocabulary learning

## Intro

Vocabulary learning plays a crucial role in the success of foreign language (FL) learning because words lie at the foundation of sentence construction as basic building blocks. Vocabulary knowledge is the most important factor in academic achievement for FL learners (Saville-Troike, 1984).

## Vocabulary Learning Strategies

- learning strategies
  - by which information obtained, stored, retrieved, used
  - be capable of making informed choices about their learning paths, and be proactive in managing and monitoring their own learning,
- varieties
  -  Stoffer (1995) categorizes fifty-three vocabulary learning strategies into nine groups
    - authentic language use
    - creative activies
    - physical actions
    - self-motivation
    - organize words
    - mental linkages
    - overcome axiety
    - memory strategies
    - auditory strategies
  - Gu and Johnson(1996)
    - beliefs about vocabulary learning
    - metacognitive and cognitive strategies(guessing, dictionary, note-taking, rehearsal, encoding, activating)
  - Schmitt’s taxonomy(1997)
    - discovery
      - determination, social
    - consolidation
      - social, memory, cognitive, metacognitive
- deep understanding and bettter use of voca -> achieve successful self-directed voca learning

## Effects of CALL on Vocabulary Learning

- tutor of vocabulary learning
- tool role
  - word recall -> text-related image
- medium role (CMC: Computer Mediated Communication)

## Research question

- CALL-based self-directed vocabulary -> learning strategies -> learning performance ?
  - group1
    - word concentration / construction / confirmation / connection / consolidation / composition (Wu, 2012)
    -  working either individually or in collaboration with others.
  - group2
    - printed material + same tasks / processes
- following rq
  - Could students’ adoption of the intended materials (either the learning system or the printed material), significantly better stimulate their overall strategy use than that of the traditional material?
  - Intended marterials vs traditional material: stimulating strategy use?
  - computer learning system >> printed marterials: overal strategy use?
  - learning system >> printed material in enhancing each strategy use?

## Experiment

- 2groups
  - english scores of the two classes in placement test -> t-test no diff
