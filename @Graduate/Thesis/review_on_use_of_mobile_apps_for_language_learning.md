  - age 12-17 years
  - elementary
    - writing creative stories
    - mastery in mathmetics
    - enhance children learning activity
      - motivation
  - **high school student voca**
    - Vocabulary development of the high school student through an app proved effective in the experiment conducted by Jennifer Betsy Redd.
    - introduce a gaming app using iPod for these students to enhance the vocabulary in the time period of three weeks.
    - **significant difference**

### Apps for Tertiary

- **tertiary learners**
  - Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) can not only enhance students’ English ability but also **increase students’ learning motivation.**
  - efficient learning
  - Li and Zou Study
    - They innovatively incorporated the English learning app to explore the students’ perspective towards mobile devices.
    - They targeted all the four basics skills and conducted the study in two phases.
    - Both the phase confirmed that the apps did motivate the students and simultaneously revealed the positive attitude of the students towards using mobile devices for learning.
  - Ornprapat and Wiwat (2015)
    - chose 80 college students to introduce M-learning into their vocabulary acquisition. They divided the first-year students into two groups (control and experimental group) with had 40 students each.
    - Through **SMS** the experimental group indulged in various exercises given to them on the basis of vocabulary acquisition whereas the control group performed paper-based exercises. The mean score of the experimental group (M = 33.25, SD = 5.67) significantly varied from the control group (M = 29.70, SD = 5.57).
  - The tertiary learners generally include the students at the college level for whom the **technological tools are not something new.** They know how to handle these tools by themselves since it has become a part of their daily activity. They interact with others especially through their Smartphones which is portable for them to carry anywhere with them.

## Finding & Conclusion

- MALL listening skill is better acquired than that of other skills.
- learning approaches
  - top down
    - gist
  - bottom up
    - voca, phrase are focuesd in understanding the concept
  - interactive
    - individual, cultural, social, ... other dimentions
- improving Listening skill is difficult
  - website
  - podcast
  - Mobile devices provide plenty of resources to develop the listening skill of the learners who can be exposed to authentic material like live streams, English songs, radio, listening to English news.

## suggestion

- Self-regulated learning can be developed by transforming these devices usage for learning the language.
  - Students choose what they will learn, how they will learn, and decide for themselves how they will assess their own learning
- which age group can handle the technology better based on the activities that are designed.
- The third can be in dealing with off-line mobile apps in poor economic countries
- focus on the teacher’s anxiety in the use of mobile tools in teaching the English Language.
