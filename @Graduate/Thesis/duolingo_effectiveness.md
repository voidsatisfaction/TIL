  - **As expected many people had difficulties keeping up with the study and their use of Duolingo for the two months of study was very uneven. Many people dropped out of the study or spent less than two hours studying Spanish. Although we informed the participants twice a week of their study time for the week this was not enough for many of them. It is highly recommended that Duolingo develops some kind of individual online clock which shows how much time each user spends by date or week**
